/**
 * Verifies the actual host's two edits in one tick.
 *
 * The shared lifecycle batch invokes this entry in its existing watch session;
 * the observable is host output or its compiler verdict, not source layout.
 *
 * 1. Apply this scenario's edit to the batch-owned mutable project.
 * 2. Observe the host and assert the required result before the next transition.
 *
 * @evidence contracts/testing.md#behavioral-verification
 *   Writes NINTH and TENTH in the same turn and expects only the final TENTH state.
 * @evidence contracts/testing.md#independent-expectations
 *   Literal contract values and explicit error patterns derive from the fixture input or supported invalid-input behavior. The host result is compared against those literals, never a snapshot computed by the adapter.
 * @evidence contracts/testing.md#distinguishing-cases
 *   Two competing writes must converge to the later state even while the host is reacting to the first event.
 * @evidence contracts/testing.md#execution-ownership
 *   This exported named E2E entry is selected through SCENARIOS by runScenarios in the packed worker, using its original inputs and failure identity. Actual installed hosts execute the delivery; no unit runner launches it.
 * @evidence contracts/e2e.md#necessary-boundary
 *   Two competing writes must converge to the later state even while the host is reacting to the first event. Direct proof calls cannot establish the actual host event, cache or delivery connection exercised here.
 * @evidence contracts/e2e.md#shared-execution
 *   Reuses the worker's installed consumer, immutable native producers and existing project/session for two edits in one tick; this entry installs nothing, builds no per-case contributor and starts no new host. A failed prerequisite state can block later dependent transitions.
 * @evidence contracts/e2e.md#state-isolation-and-reuse-validity
 *   Runs in the ordered SCENARIOS state machine on one host/producer-owned fixture. Original writes and restorations remain intact; another host or producer owns a separate mutable directory. The worker closes the session in finally after success or failure.
 * @evidence contracts/e2e.md#preserved-coverage
 *   The original two edits in one tick method body is retained as this addressable function, including all conditions and assertions. Only registration changes; runScenarios still names the case and reports pre/post records, host output and available worker diagnostics on failure.
