/**
 * Verifies cts configs load through ttsx in the shared configuration boundary.
 *
 * The .cts config retains its const config value and export-assignment form through real ttsx evaluation.
 *
 * @evidence contracts/testing.md#behavioral-verification The .cts config retains its const config value and export-assignment form through real ttsx evaluation. This original source's exact no-console/error record and error exit remain asserted.
 * @evidence contracts/testing.md#independent-expectations The original var/console source and independently authored configuration rule map define the literal one-finding expectation. The full batch owner compares nine independently literal file/line/rule/severity records.
 * @evidence contracts/testing.md#distinguishing-cases The CommonJS TypeScript export assignment contrasts with the .mts default export owner; this case does not claim a type:module parent-package contrast absent from the original fixture.
 * @evidence contracts/testing.md#execution-ownership This named entry asserts its own source-file result from configLanguageBoundaryResult. The JSON pointer entry owns exact full-stream cardinality so filtering cannot conceal extra or missing findings.
 * @evidence contracts/e2e.md#necessary-boundary The real descriptor evaluator, config module loader, native config binding and CLI diagnostic transport must connect the supported input to its original finding; direct rule or syntax tests cannot establish that module/host connection.
 * @evidence contracts/e2e.md#shared-execution One explicit JSON root follows the supported string extends chain through nine independently scoped configs in one project and one launcher/native host load. All consumers reuse one completed result and unchanged builtin producer; module evaluation still executes each actual config.
 * @evidence contracts/e2e.md#state-isolation-and-reuse-validity Each unchanged original source sits below its declaring config's BaseDir and matches only that config's literal files selector. Explicit tsconfig files exclude executable config/helper code from consumer diagnostics. The helper removes its owned project in finally, retains only output or initial preparation failure, and shares only immutable builtin artifact identity.
 * @evidence contracts/e2e.md#preserved-coverage Original module syntax, import/manifest cues, rule map, exact per-source rule/severity finding and nonzero exit remain executable. The complete nine-record owner rejects cross-case leakage or omitted cases; the source-only JSON unit preserves the separate evaluator-free decision.
