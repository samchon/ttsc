/**
 * Read the effective `compilerOptions.paths` of a tsconfig, following its
 * `extends` chain, and absolutize every mapping target.
 *
 * TypeScript merges `compilerOptions` per option key, so the effective `paths`
 * is the whole object from the nearest config in the chain that declares one
 * (own config first, then `extends` entries in reverse priority order).
 * Relative targets are anchored at the directory of the config that declares
 * them. TypeScript-Go resolves inherited relative `paths` against the declaring
 * file, not the extending one.
 *
 * The generated transform tsconfig replaces `paths` wholesale (standard
 * `extends` semantics), so the alias overlay must re-state these base mappings
 * or every tsconfig-only alias silently stops resolving. Absolutizing is
 * required because the generated config lives in a system temp directory and
 * TypeScript-Go rejects non-relative targets (TS5090) while accepting absolute
 * ones.
 *
 * Best-effort by design: a missing or unparsable config in the chain yields
 * `{}` here and a real config error from the compiler, which owns config
 * diagnostics.
