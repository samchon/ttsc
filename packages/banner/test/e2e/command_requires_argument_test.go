// TestCommandRequiresArgument verifies the banner sidecar rejects an empty command line.
//
// The banner sidecar is intentionally tested through its package-local command front door.
// These cases prove the small wrapper package can parse host commands, hand project work to the
// shared utility host, and place documentation text without relying on tests inside the plugin
// implementation directory.
//
// The native host must fail before project loading when no command is supplied. That keeps
// usage errors separate from TypeScript diagnostics and gives package managers a stable
// exit-code contract.
//
// 1. Run the real plugin binary without a subcommand.
// 2. Capture the native producer exit status and separate streams.
// 3. Assert the usage diagnostic and command-error exit code.
// @evidence contracts/testing.md#behavioral-verification The compiled banner sidecar receives no arguments and must return status 2, empty stdout and command required in stderr.
// @evidence contracts/testing.md#independent-expectations An empty invocation is a usage failure under the sidecar command contract; the expected status and diagnostic are literal, not computed by the wrapper.
// @evidence contracts/testing.md#distinguishing-cases This entry isolates empty argv from an unsupported token and a flag-shaped token; it does not supply a project that could obscure the usage failure.
// @evidence contracts/testing.md#execution-ownership The discoverable TestCommandRequiresArgument entry runs in the banner E2E population and calls the real compiled package sidecar; runPlugin captures its native exit and separate streams. This classification does not move its portable assertions into units.
// @evidence contracts/e2e.md#necessary-boundary This one native invocation checks the package entrypoint propagates an empty-argv failure into its actual exit and streams. Portable dispatch semantics are a possible direct-unit migration; this entry alone does not establish that migration.
// @evidence contracts/e2e.md#shared-execution runPlugin reaches the compiled sidecar through resolvePluginBinary, which builds ./plugin once per test process under sync.Once unless TTSC_UTILITY_TEST_BINARY names a prebuilt binary; this function starts one process with no arguments from that binary and shares no loaded project or running session with any other entry.
// @evidence contracts/e2e.md#state-isolation-and-reuse-validity The function creates no fixture; the single process exits before the assertion. TestMain removes only the fallback producer directory after m.Run, and a TTSC_UTILITY_TEST_BINARY binary stays with its supplier. No cold or invalidated state is exercised.
// @evidence contracts/e2e.md#preserved-coverage The status, empty-stdout and 'command required' stderr checks are made in this body at L34; nothing is delegated to a unit test or helper.
func TestCommandRequiresArgument(t *testing.T) {
  // Command assertion: this is the front-door guard for malformed invocations
  // from a wrapper script or an incorrectly constructed plugin descriptor.
