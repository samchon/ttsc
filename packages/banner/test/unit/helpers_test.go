// The negative resolutions assert that a project answers with nothing, and the
// walk they exercise climbs to the filesystem root by design, exactly as Node's
// does. A stray install above the system temp directory would answer for the
// project the case deliberately left empty, and the failure would read as a
// defect in the resolution rather than as pollution outside the tree. The probe
// anchors one level above `root`, so it inspects the ambient ancestry only and
// never the fixture.
